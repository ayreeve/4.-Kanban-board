# Kanban board

A serious competitor for Trello or sticky notes. Just kidding. But it is great anyway, so fell free to test (but, please, don’t be very nasty playing with cards’ and columns’ names – I can read it afterwards).

Functions – if you only want, you can:
1. Add and delete columns (use buttons for it)
2. Add and delete cards (also buttons)
3. Rename cards (double click on card name)
4. Move cards within one columns (drag and drop cards)
5. Move cards among all columns (also drag and drop)

Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- RWD
- JS, jQuery
- Grunt, Git

What’s more?
- my own design but not my hand in background
